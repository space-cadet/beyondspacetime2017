@article{Kaul2012Entropy,
	Abstract = {In the Loop Quantum Gravity, black holes (or even more general Isolated Horizons) are described by a {SU}(2) {Chern-Simons} theory. There is an equivalent formulation of the horizon degrees of freedom in terms of a U(1) gauge theory which is just a gauged fixed version of the {SU}(2) theory. These developments will be surveyed here. Quantum theory based on either formulation can be used to count the horizon micro-states associated with quantum geometry fluctuations and from this the micro-canonical entropy can be obtained. We shall review the computation in {SU}(2) formulation. Leading term in the entropy is proportional to horizon area with a coefficient depending on the {Barbero-Immirzi} parameter which is fixed by matching this result with the {Bekenstein-Hawking} formula. Remarkably there are corrections beyond the area term, the leading one is logarithm of the horizon area with a definite coefficient -3/2, a result which is more than a decade old now. How the same results are obtained in the equivalent U(1) framework will also be indicated. Over years, this entropy formula has also been arrived at from a variety of other perspectives. In particular, entropy of {BTZ} black holes in three dimensional gravity exhibits the same logarithmic correction. Even in the String Theory, many black hole models are known to possess such properties. This suggests a possible universal nature of this logarithmic correction.},

@article{Smolin1998Strings,
	Abstract = {A connection between non-perturbative formulations of quantum gravity and perturbative string theory is exhibited, based on a formulation of the non-perturbative dynamics due to Markopoulou. In this formulation the dynamics of spin network states and their generalizations is described in terms of histories which have discrete analogues of the causal structure and many fingered time of Lorentzian spacetimes. Perturbations of these histories turn out to be described in terms of spin systems defined on 2-dimensional timelike surfaces embedded in the discrete spacetime. When the history has a classical limit which is Minkowski spacetime, the action of the perturbation theory is given to leading order by the spacetime area of the surface, as in bosonic string theory. This map between a non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity and a 1+1 dimensional theory generalizes to a large class of theories in which the group SU(2) is extended to any quantum group or supergroup. It is argued that a necessary condition for the non-perturbative theory to have a good classical limit is that the resulting 1+1 dimensional theory defines a consistent and stable perturbative string theory.},

@misc{Smolin2003How-far-are-we-from,
	Abstract = {An assessment is offered of the progress that the major approaches to quantum gravity have made towards the goal of constructing a complete and satisfactory theory. The emphasis is on loop quantum gravity and string theory, although other approaches are discussed, including dynamical triangulation models (euclidean and lorentzian) regge calculus models, causal sets, twistor theory, non-commutative geometry and models based on analogies to condensed matter systems. We proceed by listing the questions the theories are expected to be able to answer. We then compile two lists: the first details the actual results so far achieved in each theory, while the second lists conjectures which remain open. By comparing them we can evaluate how far each theory has progressed, and what must still be done before each theory can be considered a satisfactory quantum theory of gravity. We find there has been impressive recent progress on several fronts. At the same time, important issues about loop quantum gravity are so far unresolved, as are key conjectures of string theory. However, there is a reasonable expectation that experimental tests of lorentz invariance at Planck scales may in the near future make it possible to rule out one or more candidate quantum theories of gravity.},

@misc{Thiemann2004The-LQG-String:,
	Abstract = {We combine I. background independent Loop Quantum Gravity ({LQG}) quantization techniques, {II}. the mathematically rigorous framework of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory ({AQFT}) and {III}. the theory of integrable systems resulting in the invariant Pohlmeyer Charges in order to set up the general representation theory (superselection theory) for the closed bosonic quantum string on flat target space. While we do not solve the, expectedly, rich representation theory completely, we present a, to the best of our knowledge new, non -- trivial solution to the representation problem. This solution exists 1. for any target space dimension, 2. for Minkowski signature of the target space, 3. without tachyons, 4. manifestly ghost -- free (no negative norm states), 5. without fixing a worldsheet or target space gauge, 6. without (Virasoro) anomalies (zero central charge), 7. while preserving manifest target space Poincar\'e invariance and 8. without picking up {UV} divergences. The existence of this stable solution is exciting because it raises the hope that among all the solutions to the representation problem (including fermionic degrees of freedom) we find stable, phenomenologically acceptable ones in lower dimensional target spaces, possibly without supersymmetry, that are much simpler than the solutions that arise via compactification of the standard Fock representation of the string. Moreover, these new representations could solve some of the major puzzles of string theory such as the cosmological constant problem. The solution presented in this paper exploits the flatness of the target space in several important ways. In a companion paper we treat the more complicated case of curved target spaces.},

	Abstract = {We note that the non-perturbative quantisation of supergravity as recently
investigated using loop quantum gravity techniques provides an opportunity to
probe an interesting sector of the {AdS}/{CFT} correspondence, which is usually not
considered in conventional treatments. In particular, assuming a certain amount
of convergence between the quantum supergravity sector of string theory and
quantum supergravity constructed via loop quantum gravity techniques, we argue
that the large quantum number expansion in loop quantum supergravity
corresponds to the \${1/N}^2\_c\$ expansion in the corresponding gauge theory. In
order to argue that we are indeed dealing with an appropriate quantum
supergravity sector of string theory, high energy (\$\alpha'\$) corrections are
being neglected, leading to a gauge theory at strong coupling, yet finite
\$N\_c\$. The arguments given in this paper are mainly of qualitative nature, with
the aim of serving as a starting point for a more in depth interaction between
the string theory and loop quantum gravity communities.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies of the fluctuations of an open string in AdS space show some pieces of evidence that the string with a worldsheet horizon could be a dual description of SYK model, as they saturate universal chaos bound and share the same symmetry. An open string hangs from the AdS boundary to the horizon of black brane could be dual to a 0+1 dimensional boundary state. To be specific, we find that the fluctuation of the string in charged BTZ black hole has an asymptotic scaling symmetry, and its Euclidean IR fixed point is governed by the quadratic order of Schwarzian action, which is just the low energy effective theory of the SYK model. Considering the open string worldsheet also has natural reparametrization symmetry, we conjecture that the action of the string worldsheet is a dual description of SYK state.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines two cosmological models of quantum gravity (from string theory and loop quantum gravity) to investigate the foundational and conceptual issues arising from quantum treatments of the big bang. While the classical singularity is erased, the quantum evolution that replaces it may not correspond to classical spacetime: it may instead be a non-spatiotemporal region, which somehow transitions to a spatiotemporal state. The different kinds of transition involved are partially characterized, the concept of a physical transition without time is investigated, and the problem of empirical incoherence for regions without spacetime is discussed.},

@article{Krasnov2009Black,
	Abstract = {Quantum black holes have been studied extensively in quantum gravity and string theory, using various semiclassical or background dependent approaches. We explore the possibility of studying black holes in the full non-perturbative quantum theory, without recurring to semiclassical considerations, and in the context of loop quantum gravity. We propose a definition of a quantum black hole as the collection of the quantum degrees of freedom that do not influence observables at infinity. From this definition, it follows that for an observer at infinity a black hole is described by an SU(2) intertwining operator. The dimension of the Hilbert space of such intertwiners grows exponentially with the horizon area. These considerations shed some light on the physical nature of the microstates contributing to the black hole entropy. In particular, it can be seen that the microstates being counted for the entropy have the interpretation of describing different horizon shapes. The space of black hole microstates described here is related to the one arrived at recently by Engle, Noui and Perez, and sometime ago by Smolin, but obtained here directly within the full quantum theory.},

We describe the formalism of {CDT}, its phase diagram, and the quantum geometries emerging from it. We also argue that the formalism should be able to describe a more general class of quantum-gravitational models of {Horava-Lifshitz} type.},

@article{Padmanabhan2004From,
	Abstract = {There is a general belief, reinforced by statements in standard textbooks, that: (i) one can obtain the full non-linear Einstein's theory of gravity by coupling a massless, spin-2 field \$h\_{ab}\$ self-consistently to the total energy momentum tensor, including its own; (ii) this procedure is unique and leads to Einstein-Hilbert action and (iii) it only uses standard concepts in Lorentz invariant field theory and does not involve any geometrical assumptions. After providing several reasons why such beliefs are suspect -- and critically re-examining several previous attempts -- we provide a detailed analysis aimed at clarifying the situation. First, we prove that it is \textit{impossible} to obtain the Einstein-Hilbert (EH) action, starting from the standard action for gravitons in linear theory and iterating repeatedly. Second, we use the Taylor series expansion of the action for Einstein's theory, to identify the tensor \$\mathcal{S}^{ab}\$, to which the graviton field \$h\_{ab}\$ couples to the lowest order. We show that the second rank tensor \$\mathcal{S}^{ab}\$ is {\it not} the conventional energy momentum tensor \$T^{ab}\$ of the graviton and provide an explanation for this feature. Third, we construct the full nonlinear Einstein's theory with the source being spin-0 field, spin-1 field or relativistic particles by explicitly coupling the spin-2 field to this second rank tensor \$\mathcal{S}^{ab}\$ order by order and summing up the infinite series. Finally, we construct the theory obtained by self consistently coupling \$h\_{ab}\$ to the conventional energy momentum tensor \$T^{ab}\$ order by order and show that this does {\it not} lead to Einstein's theory. (condensed).},

	Abstract = {{The existence of long range macroscopic attractive forces between masses implies the existence of a mediating helicity $\pm$ 2 particle in special relativistic quantum particle theory. It is shown that this fact alone, without assuming the existence of an underlying tensor field, uniquely determines the long wavelength structure of quantum gravitation to be that of Einstein's theory. This equivalence is shown by deriving, from the Ward identities associated with the graviton propagator, the tree graph structure of the graviton-graviton and graviton-matter interaction and establishing that the classical Einstein action is the generating functional. Some properties of closed loop effects are also exhibited.}},

With the help of this notation, equivalence moves, namely translations and rotations, can be defined, which relate the projections of diffeomorphic embeddings of a spin network. Certain types of topological structures, viz 3-strand braids as local excitations of embedded spin networks, are defined and classified by means of the equivalence moves.

	Abstract = {We study interactions amongst topologically conserved excitations of quantum theories of gravity, in particular the braid excitations of four-valent spin networks. These have been shown previously to propagate and interact under evolution rules of spin foam models. We show that the dynamics of these braid excitations can be described by an effective theory based on Feynman diagrams. In this language, braids which are actively interacting are analogous to bosons, in that the topological conservation laws permit them to be singly created and destroyed. Exchanges of these excitations give rise to interactions between braids which are charged under the topological conservation rules.},

@article{Ashtekar2004Background,
	Abstract = {The goal of this review is to present an introduction to loop quantum gravity--a background-independent, non-perturbative approach to the problem of unification of general relativity and quantum physics, based on a quantum theory of geometry. Our presentation is pedagogical. Thus, in addition to providing a bird's eye view of the present status of the subject, the review should also serve as a vehicle to enter the field and explore it in detail. To aid non-experts, very little is assumed beyond elements of general relativity, gauge theories and quantum field theory. While the review is essentially self-contained, the emphasis is on communicating the underlying ideas and the significance of results rather than on presenting systematic derivations and detailed proofs. (These can be found in the listed references.) The subject can be approached in different ways. We have chosen one which is deeply rooted in well-established physics and also has sufficient mathematical precision to ensure that there are no hidden infinities. In order to keep the review to a reasonable size, and to avoid overwhelming non-experts, we have had to leave out several interesting topics, results and viewpoints; this is meant to be an introduction to the subject rather than an exhaustive review of it.},

	Abstract = {Euclidean gravity method has been successful in computing logarithmic corrections to extremal black hole entropy in terms of low energy data, and gives results in perfect agreement with the microscopic results in string theory. Motivated by this success we apply Euclidean gravity to compute logarithmic corrections to the entropy of various non-extremal black holes in different dimensions, taking special care of integration over the zero modes and keeping track of the ensemble in which the computation is done. These results provide strong constraint on any ultraviolet completion of the theory if the latter is able to give an independent computation of the entropy of non-extremal black holes from microscopic description. For Schwarzschild black holes in four space-time dimensions the macroscopic result seems to disagree with the existing result in loop quantum gravity.},

@article{Morales-Tecotl1994Fermions,
	Abstract = {{We study the quantum fermions+gravity system, that is, the gravitational counterpart of QED. We start from the standard Einstein-Weyl theory, reformulated in terms of Ashtekar variables; and we construct its non- perturbative quantum theory by extending the loop representation of general relativity. We construct the fermion equivalent to the loop variables. Not surprisingly, fermions can be incorporated in the loop representation simply by including open curves into ''Loop space''. We explicitely construct the diffeomorphism and hamiltonain operators. The first can be fully solved as in pure gravity. The second is constructed by using a background-independent regularization technique. The theory retains the clean geometrical features of the pure quantum gravity. In particular, the hamiltonian constraint admits the same simple geometrical interpretation as its pure gravity counterpart. Quite surprisingly, a simple action codes the full dynamics of the interacting theory. To unravel the dynamics of the theory we study the evolution of the fermion-gravity system in the physical-time defined by an additional coupled (''clock''-) scalar field. We construct the Hamiltonian operator that evolves the system in this physical time. We show that this Hamiltonian is finite, diffeomorphism invariant, and has a simple geometrical action. The theory fermions+gravity evolving in the clock time is finally given by the combinatorial and geometrical action of this Hamiltonian on a set of graphs with a finite number of end points. This action defines the "topological Feynman rules" of the theory.}},

A basic dynamics is developed by treating the binding of preons as topological in nature and identifying the substructure of quarks, leptons and gauge bosons with elements of the braid group B\_3. Topological considerations and a straightforward set of assumptions lead directly to behaviour consistent with much of the known phenomenology of the Standard Model. The preons of this model may be viewed as composite in nature, and composed of sub-preons, representing exactly two levels of substructure within quarks and leptons.},

	Abstract = {We show that a class of background independent models of quantum spacetime have local excitations that can be mapped to the first generation fermions of the standard model of particle physics. These states propagate coherently as they can be shown to be noiseless subsystems of the microscopic quantum dynamics. These are identified in terms of certain patterns of braiding of graphs, thus giving a quantum gravitational foundation for the topological preon model proposed by one of us. <br />These results apply to a large class of theories in which the Hilbert space has a basis of states given by ribbon graphs embedded in a three-dimensional manifold up to diffeomorphisms, and the dynamics is given by local moves on the graphs, such as arise in the representation theory of quantum groups. For such models, matter appears to be already included in the microscopic kinematics and dynamics.},

@article{Vaid2010Embedding,
	Abstract = {We argue that the Quadratic Spinor Lagrangian approach allows us to approach the problem of forming a geometrical condensate of spinorial tetrads in a natural manner. This, along with considerations involving the discrete symmetries of lattice triangulations, lead us to discover that the quasiparticles of such a condensate are tetrahedra with braids attached to its faces and that these braid attachments correspond to the preons in Bilson-Thompson's model of elementary particles. These "spatoms" can then be put together in a tiling to form more complex structures which encode both geometry and matter in a natural manner. We conclude with some speculations on the relation between this picture and the computational universe hypothesis.},

We point out a further feature of these variables: the so(3)-invariant norm of the variable conjugate to Ashtekar\^{a}{\^A}{\^A}s connection, namely, the inverse densitized triad or the analogue of the electric field, is the area two-form; that is, it is the two-form that gives physical area to any surface. The new variables naturally determine areas in the same way in which the metric tensor naturally determines lengths.},

@article{Rovelli1994Discreteness,
	Abstract = {We study the operator that corresponds to the measurement of volume, in non-perturbative quantum gravity, and we compute its spectrum. The operator is constructed in the loop representation, via a regularization procedure; it is finite, background independent, and diffeomorphism-invariant, and therefore well defined on the space of diffeomorphism invariant states (knot states). We find that the spectrum of the volume of any physical region is discrete. A family of eigenstates are in one to one correspondence with the spin networks, which were introduced by Penrose in a different context. We compute the corresponding component of the spectrum, and exhibit the eigenvalues explicitly. The other eigenstates are related to a generalization of the spin networks, and their eigenvalues can be computed by diagonalizing finite dimensional matrices. Furthermore, we show that the eigenstates of the volume diagonalize also the area operator. We argue that the spectra of volume and area determined here can be considered as predictions of the loop-representation formulation of quantum gravity on the outcomes of (hypothetical) Planck-scale sensitive measurements of the geometry of space.},

@book{Smolin2006The-trouble,
	Abstract = {{\{}In this groundbreaking book, the renowned theoretical physicist Lee Smolin argues that fundamental physicsthe search for the laws of natureis losing its way. One of the major problems, according to Smolin, is the growing gulf between the speculations of theorists and reality as revealed by experiment. Ambitious ideas about extra dimensions, exotic particles, multiple universes, and strings have captured our imaginations. But these ideas have not been tested experimentally, and somestring theory, for exampleseem to offer no possibility for experimental tests. And because these ideas have tied up funding and talent to the detriment of other pursuits, they threaten to impede the progress of science. With clarity, passion, and authority, Smolin charts the rise and fall of string theory and takes a fascinating look at what will replace it.{\}}},

	Abstract = {We present a pedagogical introduction to the notions underlying the connection formulation of General Relativity - Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) - with an emphasis on the physical aspects of the framework. We explain, in a concise and clear manner, the steps leading from the Einstein-Hilbert action for gravity to the construction of the quantum states of geometry, known as \emph{spin-networks}, which provide the basis for the kinematical Hilbert space of quantum general relativity. Along the way we introduce the various associated concepts of \emph{tetrads}, \emph{spin-connection} and \emph{holonomies} which are a pre-requisite for understanding the LQG formalism. Having provided a minimal introduction to the LQG framework, we discuss its applications to the problems of black hole entropy and of quantum cosmology. A list of the most common criticisms of LQG is presented, which are then tackled one by one in order to convince the reader of the physical viability of the theory. An extensive set of appendices provide accessible introductions to several key notions such as the \emph{Peter-Weyl theorem}, \emph{duality} of differential forms and \emph{Regge calculus}, among others. The presentation is aimed at graduate students and researchers who have some familiarity with the tools of quantum mechanics and field theory and/or General Relativity, but are intimidated by the seeming technical prowess required to browse through the existing LQG literature. Our hope is to make the formalism appear a little less bewildering to the un-initiated and to help lower the barrier for entry into the field.},
